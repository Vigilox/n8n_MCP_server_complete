# n8n Workflow Management Concepts

## Overview

n8n is a powerful workflow automation platform that allows users to create, manage, and execute workflows connecting various services and APIs. This document outlines the key concepts related to n8n workflow management that are relevant to our MCP server implementation.

## Core Concepts

### Workflows

A workflow in n8n is a series of connected nodes that process data. Workflows can be:

- **Active**: Running and processing triggers
- **Inactive**: Not currently processing triggers
- **Manual**: Executed only when manually triggered

Workflows consist of:
- **Nodes**: Individual processing steps
- **Connections**: Links between nodes that define data flow
- **Triggers**: Events that start workflow execution

### Executions

An execution is a single run of a workflow. Each execution:

- Has a unique ID
- Contains execution data for each node
- Has a status (running, success, error)
- Includes timing information
- Stores input and output data

### Credentials

Credentials in n8n store authentication information for connecting to external services. They are:

- Encrypted in the database
- Referenced by nodes in workflows
- Managed through the n8n interface or API

## Workflow Management Operations

### Creating Workflows

Workflows can be created:
- Through the n8n web interface
- Via the n8n API
- By importing workflow JSON definitions

### Executing Workflows

Workflows can be executed in several ways:

1. **Automatically via triggers**: When trigger conditions are met
2. **Manually via the UI**: By clicking the "Execute Workflow" button
3. **Via the API**: By calling the execution endpoints
4. **Via webhooks**: If the workflow contains webhook nodes
5. **On a schedule**: Using the Cron node

### Monitoring Workflows

n8n provides several ways to monitor workflows:

- **Execution list**: View all past executions
- **Execution details**: Examine specific execution data
- **Logs**: Check system logs for errors
- **Active executions**: See currently running workflows

### Managing Workflow Data

Workflow data management includes:

- **Input data**: Data provided to start a workflow
- **Node data**: Data processed by each node
- **Output data**: Final results of the workflow
- **Binary data**: Files and other binary content

## API-Based Workflow Management

For our MCP server, we'll focus on these API-based workflow management capabilities:

### Workflow Discovery

- Listing all workflows
- Filtering workflows by name, tags, or status
- Getting detailed workflow information

### Workflow Execution

- Triggering workflow execution
- Providing input parameters
- Specifying execution options

### Execution Monitoring

- Checking execution status
- Retrieving execution results
- Handling execution errors

### Workflow Modification (Optional)

- Creating new workflows
- Updating existing workflows
- Activating/deactivating workflows

## Best Practices

### Performance Considerations

- **Execution Timeout**: Set appropriate timeouts for long-running workflows
- **Concurrency**: Be aware of concurrent execution limits
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU usage for complex workflows

### Error Handling

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- **Error Notifications**: Set up notifications for workflow failures
- **Logging**: Maintain detailed logs for troubleshooting

### Security

- **API Key Management**: Securely store and rotate API keys
- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive workflows
- **Data Handling**: Be careful with sensitive data in workflow parameters
